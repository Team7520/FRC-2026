# FRC-2026
## FRC 7520 Team MineKee Official FRC Robot Code for the 2026 Season
[![Build](https://github.com/Team7520/FRC-2026/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Team7520/FRC-2026/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository contains the primary codebase for Team MineKee's 2026 competition robot. It is built using the AdvantageKit framework for logging and replay, utilizing CTRE Swerve Generator for high-performance drivetrain control.

Read Before Use: This code is highly specialized for our 2026 hardware configuration. If you are a student from another team (or a Team MineKee member starting a new project), we strongly recommend starting with the AdvantageKit Templates rather than cloning this repository directly.
